We copied the ifc_parser code from https://github.com/gsimon75/IFC_parser (commit: 4f6a8e037eab743449d14edbfc15640e8ef6dec6).

Since the original code is python 2.*, we had to adapt to our purposes:
- xrange was changed to range
- imports had to be scoped with their namespace
- print was changed to print()
- unichr was changed to chr
- extensions of the two template files were changed to .txt
- variables s and pos were swapped in transcode_string_literal (lines 170-175)
- pycharm 'Reformat code' were run across ifc_parser
- tail remarks are removed from EXPRESS file before parsing
- parsing of defspec in Entity was adapted so that it can handle statements like ABSTRACT SUPERTYPE and ABSTRACT SUPERTYPE OF
(they are needed for ISO15926)
- parsing of defspec in Entity was adapted so that it can handle statements like SUBTYPE OF(
(they are needed for HQDM)
- constructor for TYPE allows for null parser
- empty defspec attributes for Type allowed

# START EDIT - AMi 20201210
These comment sections have been added to note where the code has been changed to allow objects to store the code blocks that created them
